Chem Cam specs:

Remote Micro-Imager: one of Curiosity's "eyes," captures detailed images of the area illuminated by the laser beam

Laser: vaporizes rock surfaces, creating a plasma of their component gases

Spectrometer: three spectrographs divide the plasma light into wavelengths for chemical analysis
